                      The robotics wing of the club has done some remarkable work in the domains of robotics, Internet of Things, Embedded Systems and several electronics projects. We develop models by taking inspiration from many
                      software tools because we believe a product can always be smarter. This is a good chance to experiment with your theoretical knowledge and push your technical boundaries.
