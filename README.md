Website for Zairza Technical Society, the technical club of CET-Bhubaneswar.

## About us
ZAIRZA, a society, a cult for CETIANS who want to be ahead in the game. Sure
we all have talent, in this club we put our talents through many obstacles and
we conquer them. We walk out as winners who not only read books all these
years but test the theories and sometimes make our own. The club is managed
by its students and alumni. The society was founded in the year 2005 and got a
officially recognition in the year 2007 as a technical society of CET.
